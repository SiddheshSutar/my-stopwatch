# STOPWATCH

Stopwatch created using HTML ad CSS, assisted with plain javascript


ABOUT THIS PROJECT-:

  1. From the U side , in HTML, Bootstrap is used for giving the app a basic layout
  2. Google fonts are used for varied styled fonts
  3. In script.js, the logic resides for three buttons in UI - Start, Stop, Reset ('Resume' - as and when applicable)

# How to run?
For VS Code, use the extension 'Live Server' for better simulation and hot reloading

# Whats new? ( IMPORTANT )
Here there are no three default buttons - Start-Stop-Reset being shown altogether in UI.
Since, Start and Stop would come in either of their usecases; they have been toggled via javascript.
